⚠️ This portfolio still under development, some **links may not yet work**. See video: https://youtu.be/2xx_2XNxxfA.

Additionally, the design is far from finished (probably).

## Developing

To run the app, first ensure dependencies are installed

```bash
npm i
```

Then run the following command

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy the app, an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) may need to be installed for the target target environment.
